# School-orientation-chatbot

Chatbots, as the name suggests, are computer programs built to simulate human conversations.

In this project we try to build a chatbot used for school orientation (for higher and primary education) using python, nltk, pytorch, flask.

An interface will be created to guide the students of the college and high school. Indeed, with regard to middle school and high school students (Core + 1st year Baccalaureate), on the basis of a set of questions concerning their favorite subjects, the stream that corresponds the most to them is proposed. In the case of graduates, questions will be asked about their priorities, from which the field most suitable to them will be proposed.
